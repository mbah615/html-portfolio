<h1>The Best Anime According to John</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Anime of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>My Hero Academia (MHA)</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime. I like the plot and how villains get to communicate their perspective</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>Rengoku is not only peak, but one of the best hashira. Gyomei is way too powerful. All in all the anime is goated.</p>

<h3>Solo Leveling</h3>
<p>Jing Wo is a peak main character. How do you go from a D-rank to an A-rank after a near death encounter. PEAK!!!</p>
